* Decoupled game logic from graphics allowed me to create unit tests from the undo, hint and game outcomes in edit mode (detached from unity) easily
* Implemeted MiniMax algorithm with step caching to insure fast response (time complexity). when came to the choice between fps and memmory usage, chose fps, yet minimized the cost of memmory using cache.
* Implemented adaptive search for asset bundles to reduce human error, and make the UX better.
